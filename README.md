### Exercise 1

Display the message "Your time is limited, so
don’t waste it living someone else’s life" Steve Jobs on different
lines. Example output:

    “Your time is limited, 
        so don't waste it
            living someone else’s life”
                Steve Jobs

### Exercise 2

The user enters two numbers from the keyboard.
The First 
number is the value, the second number is the percentage that
needs to be calculated.
For example, we entered from the keyboard
50 and 10. You want to display 10 percent of 50.
Result: 5

### Exercise 3

The user enters three numbers from the keyboard. You need to create a number containing these digits. For example,
if 7, 3, 8 are entered from the keyboard, then you need to form the number 738.

### Exercise 4

The user enters a six-digit number. Necessary
change the first and sixth digits in this number, as well as
second and fifth digits.
For example, 723895 should become 593827.
If the user entered a non-six-digit number, an error message must be displayed.

### Exercise 5

The user enters the month number from the keyboard (from
1 to 12).
Depending on the month number received, 
the program displays the inscription: Winter (if entered
value 1.2 or 12), Spring (if a value from 3 is entered
to 5), Summer (if a value from 6 to 8 is entered), Autumn
(if a value from 9 to 11 is entered).
If the user entered a value not in the range of 1
up to 12, it is required to display an error message.

### Exercise 6

The user enters the number of meters using the keyboard. Depending on the user's choice, the program
Converts meters to miles, inches or yards.

### Exercise 7

The user enters two numbers from the keyboard.
We Need to
show all odd numbers in the specified range.
If
The range boundaries are specified incorrectly, the boundaries need to be normalized.
For example, user
entered 20 and 11, normalization is required, after which
the beginning of the range will be equal to 11, and the end to 20.

### Exercise 8

Display the multiplication table in the range,
specified by the user. For example, if the user
indicated 3 and 5, the table might look like this:

3*1 = 3 3*2 = 6 3*3 = 9 ………… 3* 10 = 30
……………………………………………………
5*1 = 5 5 *2 = 10 5 *3 = 15 ………….

### Exercise 9

In a one-dimensional array filled with random
numbers, determine the minimum and maximum
elements, count the number of negative elements, count the number of positive elements, count the number of zeros. Display results
to the screen.

### Exercise 10

There is a one-dimensional array filled with random
numbers.
Based on the data in this array, you need:

■ Create a one-dimensional array containing only
even numbers from the first array;

■ Create a one-dimensional array containing only
odd numbers from the first array;

■ Create a one-dimensional array containing only
negative numbers from the first array;

■ Create a one-dimensional array containing only
positive numbers from the first array.

### Exercise 11

Write a method that displays a horizontal or vertical line from a certain character.
The method takes as a parameter: line length,
direction, symbol.

### Exercise 12

Write a method to sort an array in descending order
or increasing depending on the user's choice.
